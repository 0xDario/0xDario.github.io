<p>I started programming back in 2015 when I took a introductory programming course in High school. 5 years later I'm still learning and that is what keeps me excited and passionate about software development, is that there is always something new to learn or ways to improve upon your existing skills.</p><!-- owlsqweoifjqwoefijqwoeifjqwoefijwef -->
